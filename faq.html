<b>How Do I Adopt a Pet I See On Fur Buddies?</b>

    Fur Buddies is a website and searchable database for over 11,000 animal shelters and rescue groups across Asia to post their adoptable pets.
    While Fur Buddies does provide a web-based adoption platform for groups across Asia, we are not involved in any of our members’ pet adoptions. 
    Each adoption group using our site has its own adoption policies and procedures and solely handles its own pet adoptions. 
    To adopt a pet you see listed on Fur Buddies, please click the “Ask About” button on the pet’s profile. You will then be given the group’s contact information and, if an email is available for that group, you will be able to email that group using our form.</li>
<ul><li><b>How Do I Meet a Pet I See on Fur Buddies?</b>
    Once you find a pet you’re interested in adopting, you’ll probably want to meet him or her. 
    Go to the Pet Profile page by clicking on the pet’s picture or name on a search results page. 
    This takes you to the pet’s detail page. Click “Ask About” to directly contact the shelter or rescue to inquire further.</li>
<li><b>Does Contacting the Shelter or Rescue Group Reserve the Pet I’m Interested In?</b>
    Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee that the pet you’ve inquired about will still be available. 
    For more information regarding the status of your inquiry, or the pet you’ve applied for, please contact the shelter or rescue group that listed the pet. 
    The shelter’s address and contact information can also be found on the pet’s profile page.</li>
<li><b>Do I Need to Apply to Fur Buddies?</b>
    No. Once you’ve submitted an inquiry to an adoption group, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will be sent your information. 
    It is then up to the shelter or rescue group to determine whether it’s a match.</li>
<li><b>How Will I Know If I’ve Been Approved to Adopt a Pet?</b>
    After submitting an adoption inquiry, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will contact you. 
    You may also reach out to the shelter or rescue group directly to follow up. </li>
<li><b>How Long Will It Take to Hear Back from the Adoption Group?</b>
    Fur Buddies is a community and, like all communities, each individual or organization is a little bit different. 
    Some days you might send in an inquiry and get a response within a few minutes and other groups may take a few days or a week. 
    Don’t be afraid to follow up with the shelter or rescue group.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Does Contacting the Adoption Group Put The Pet on Hold?</b>
    Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee the pet you’ve applied for, nor does it place a pet “on hold”.  For more information regarding the status of your application, or the pet you’ve applied for, please contact the shelter or rescue group listing the pet directly.</li>
<li><b>Am I Applying to Fur Buddies?</b>
    No. Once you’ve submitted an inquiry to an adoption group, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will be sent your information. It is then up to the shelter or rescue group to determine whether it’s a match.</li>
<li><b>How Will I Know If I've Been Approved to Adopt a Pet?</b>
    After submitting an adoption inquiry, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will contact you. You may also reach out to the shelter or rescue group directly to follow up.</li>
<li><b>How Long Will It Take to Hear Back From The Adoption Group?</b>
    Fur Buddies is a community and, like all communities, each individual or organization is a little bit different. 
    Ideally, when you visit an animal shelter someone will greet you when you walk through the door, escort you in to meet the pets and answer your questions. 
    Sometimes though, the person at the desk is on a tough phone call, everyone in the reception office is tied up with two boxes of kittens that just arrived, and the volunteer in the dog kennels just started and has as many questions as you do. 
    Likewise, some days you might send in an inquiry and get a response within a few minutes and other groups may take a few days or a week. Don’t be afraid to follow up with the shelter or rescue group.</li></ul>

<b>What Are The Requirements For Adopting A Pet?</b>

Each adoption group that lists its pets on Fur Buddies has its own rules and requirements for adopting pets. 
If you’re interested in a specific pet, please reach out to the adoption group that created the pet listing to find out what their policies are.    
    
<ul>
<li><b>Can I Adopt a Pet Who’s Out of State?</b>
    Thank you for your interest in adopting a pet! Each adoption group that lists its pets on Fur Buddies has its own rules and requirements for adopting out pets. Fur Buddies doesn’t dictate adoption group policy, including adoption requirements and whether out-of-state adoptions are allowed by each group. If you’re interested in a specific pet, please reach out to the adoption group that has that pet. (You can contact the group using the contact information found of the pet’s profile page)</li>
<li><b>Will There Be An Adoption Fee?</b>
    Fur Buddies doesn’t dictate adoption group policy, including adoption requirements and fees. If you’re interested in a specific pet, please contact the adoption group that created the pet listing through the Pet Profile page or Member Home Page.</li>
<li><b>Why Do Shelters and Rescue Groups Charge Adoption Fees?</b>
    Adoption fees help cover the medical care of the animal while he or she waits for a new home, as well as food and transportation costs. These fees help to provide care for the other animals in the shelter or rescue group who may have medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The money also acts as a donation to help support the organization as a whole, allowing the group to continue its efforts to rescue and rehome pets.</li>
</ul>
    </p>
 <b> Why Wasn't I Selected to Adopt?</b>
 <p>Thank you for thinking adoption first! Each shelter and rescue group has its own adoption process. 
    We do not dictate adoption procedures to our Fur Buddies members, although we do encourage them to do everything possible to facilitate finding good homes for their adoptable pets. 
    We hope you won’t let this one experience change your mind about providing a loving home to a pet in need. There are many animal shelters and rescue groups with many more adoptable pets waiting for their forever homes! 
    Thank you for helping an adoptable pet and we wish you the best of luck in your search to find a new member of your family. If you have specific questions or concerns about a shelter, 
    please contact us below.</p>
<b>How Can I Tell If a Rescue Group is Real or a Scam? </b>    
<p>All the adoption groups that list their pets on Fur Buddies have been carefully screened by our shelter outreach staff. If you have concerns about a shelter or rescue group listed on Fur Buddies, please contact us. If you’re looking outside of Fur Buddies for a pet to adopt, there are some red flags to keep an eye out for. No one point alone proves whether a group is or is not legitimate. If you find several of these warning signs, you might want to look for your adoptable pet elsewhere.</p>

<b>How Do I Make a Complaint About a Shelter or Rescue Group? </b>  
<p>All of the animal shelters and rescue groups on our site undergo an application and screening process prior to being able to post their group’s adoptable pets. They must also provide a letter of reference from their primary veterinarian. If you have concerns about a particular shelter or rescue group posting on our site, you are welcome to contact us. It’s important to us that our member shelters and rescue groups remain in good standing in the animal welfare community. Please be sure to include the full name, city, and state of the group you are referring to.<br>
    Note: Specific complaints about rescue groups included in the comments below will be deleted. Please be sure to email us any concerns.
